# Q-4. Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(). impty(), 
# isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack.
# All these operations of SpecialStack must have a time and space complexity of 0(1).

# Note: To implement SpecialStack, you should only use standard Stack data structure and no other data structura 
# like arrays list ate
